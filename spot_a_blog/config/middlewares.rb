# All Rack middlewares should go in a block like the one below. Different
# combinations can be used for different versions by setting the first argument
# of the middleware!  method to a symbol containing the name of the environment
# (e.g. :live).

# For development purposes we'll be loading various middlewares to make it
# easier to detect errors, reloading the code and so on.

  # requests so it's fairly useless out of the box, it can be useful for custom
  # extensions and such.

  # for checking if a certain page has been modified or not.

  # IMPORTANT: Prior to Rack 1.2.2 Rack::ETag required the second argument of
  # use() to be set to 'public'. Newer versions no longer require this.
